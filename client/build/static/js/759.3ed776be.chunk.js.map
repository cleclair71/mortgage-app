These renewals are frequently offered at posted rates, which can be approximately 2% higher than the best discounted rates for a 5-year term. Unfortunately, this approach doesn't necessarily serve the best interests of their clients, as banks rely on the likelihood that most will blindly accept and sign the renewal without questioning.\n                        </Text>\n                        <Text mb={3}>\n                            Shockingly, statistics show that approximately 70-80% of individuals simply sign and return the renewal, unknowingly forfeiting potential savings amounting to thousands of dollars in interest. Allow Dora to handle the shopping for you, leveraging our extensive network of competing banks, credit unions, and lenders to secure the best deal available in the industry.
